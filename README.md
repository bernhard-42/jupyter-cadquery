## Overview

_Jupyter-CadQuery_  release 4 is a complete rewrite of _Jupyter-CadQuery_ 3: 

It is now based on:

- the show logic provided by [ocp_vscode](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer) (_OCP CAD Viewer for VS Code_),
- the viewer is [three-cad-viewer](https://github.com/bernhard-42/three-cad-viewer)
- the tessellation logic provided by [ocp-tessellate](https://github.com/bernhard-42/ocp-tessellate),
- the communication between Python and Javascript provided by [cad-viewer-widget](https://github.com/bernhard-42/cad-viewer-widget), a custom [ipywidget](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets),
- and the new (!) measurement feature provided again by [ocp_vscode](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer)

**Note:** For changes see the migration section at the end of this page.

## Key Features

- Code CAD support
  - _CadQuery >= 2.5_ including _master_ (as of 2025-04)
  - _build123d_ >=0.9 including _master_ (as of 2025-04)
  - _OCP_ == 7.8.X (as of 2025-04)

- Viewing options:
  - View CAD models as JupyterLab output cells
  - View CAD models in one JupyterLab sidecar
  - View CAD models in separate windows in JupyterLab
  - For sidecar and window-based viewers, the viewers resize with the size of the container window. You can have a fixed aspect ratio (height to width ratio) or fill the complete container window.
  - Auto display of _CadQuery_ and _build123d_ shapes
  - Replay mode for CadQuery objects

- Animations (see examples below)
  - Support [animated CadQuery assemblies](https://github.com/bernhard-42/cadquery-massembly)
  - Support [animated build123d assemblies](https://github.com/bernhard-42/bd_animation)
  - Animated explode mode for _CadQuery_ and _build123d_ assemblies

- Viewer features
  - Clipping with max 3 clipping planes (of free orientation) with cap faces being properly shown
  - Toggle visibility of shapes and edges
  - Orthographic and perspective view
  - Simple material editor (light intensity, metalness and roughness)
  - Transparency mode
  - Double click on shapes shows bounding box info
  - Click on tree labels shows bounding box info and optionally hides or isolates the elements (use the modifier keys described in online help)


## Examples

### The viewer

View CAD objects with or without a grid and axes, with orthographic or perspective cameras and buttons for standard views like 'Front' and 'Top', with or without transparent faces:

![Hexapod](screenshots/hexapod.png)

### Measurement mode

Measure distances between objects, angles between edges and faces, and show selected object properties like center, area, and volume 

![Exploded Quadruped](screenshots/measure.gif)

### Animation System - explode assemblies

The animation system allows to explode CadQuery and build123d assemblies or a group of CAD objects. The center of the CAD explosion effect is `(0,0,0)`.

## Installation

### Install Juypter-CadQuery

- **CadQuery**

  1. Create and activate a virtual conda environment

      ```bash
      mamba create -n jcq4 python=3.12.9
      mamba activate jcq4
      ```

  2. Install latest cadquery master

      ```bash
      mamba install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery=master
      ```

  3. Install Jupyter CadQuery

      ```bash
      pip install jupyter-cadquery
      ```

  4. Run Jupyter CadQuery
  
      ```bash
      jupyter lab
      ```

- **build123d**

  1. Create and activate a virtual environment (conda, pyenv-virtualenv, ...)

  2. Install build123d

      ```bash
      pip install build123d
      ```

  3. Install Jupyter CadQuery

      ```bash
      pip install jupyter-cadquery
      ```

  4. Run Jupyter CadQuery

      ```bash
      jupyter lab
      ```

### Verfiy the installation

**Note**: On a Mac the first run of the below commands can take minutes until the native libraries OCP and vtk are initialized. Afterwards it takes seconds only.

1. Check the Jupyter lab extension, the viewer frontend: `jupyter lab extension list`

    ```bash
    Config dir: /Users/<username>/.jupyter

    Config dir: /Users/<username>/.pyenv/versions/3.12.9/envs/jcq4/etc/jupyter
        jupyter_lsp enabled
        - Validating jupyter_lsp...
        jupyter_lsp 2.2.5 OK
        jupyter_cadquery enabled

        - Validating jupyter_cadquery...
        jupyter_cadquery 4.0.2 OK

        jupyter_server_terminals enabled
        - Validating jupyter_server_terminals...
        jupyter_server_terminals 0.5.3 OK
        jupyterlab enabled
        - Validating jupyterlab...
        jupyterlab 4.4.0 OK
        notebook_shim enabled
        - Validating notebook_shim...
        notebook_shim  OK

    Config dir: /usr/local/etc/jupyter
    ```

    You should again see `jupyter_cadquery 4.0.2 OK`. This ensures that the **viewer frontend** is properly installed

2. Check the Jupyter server extension, the measurement backend: `jupyter server extension list`

    ```bash
    Config dir: /Users/<username>/.jupyter

    Config dir: /Users/<username>/.pyenv/versions/3.12.9/envs/jcq4/etc/jupyter
        jupyter_lsp enabled
        - Validating jupyter_lsp...
        jupyter_lsp 2.2.5 OK
        jupyter_cadquery enabled

        - Validating jupyter_cadquery...
    Extension package jupyter_cadquery took 1.6050s to import
        jupyter_cadquery 4.0.2 OK

        jupyter_server_terminals enabled
        - Validating jupyter_server_terminals...
        jupyter_server_terminals 0.5.3 OK
        jupyterlab enabled
        - Validating jupyterlab...
        jupyterlab 4.4.0 OK
        notebook_shim enabled
        - Validating notebook_shim...
        notebook_shim  OK

    Config dir: /usr/local/etc/jupyter
    ```

    You should see `jupyter_cadquery 4.0.2 OK`. This ensures that the **measurement backend** is properly installed.

    If you see "Extension package jupyter_cadquery took ...", this is basically OCP and VTK loading time (this test import OCP and with that VTK).

## Standalone version

The *standalone version* of _Jupyter CadQuery_ is now replaced with the one of _OCP CAD Viewer for VS Code_. To start it:

1. Activate your python environment
2. Execute `python -m ocp_vscode [--port <port number>]`

3939/tcp is the standard port that will be used automatically by the `show` commands.

## Create and use the docker image

The container image is not uploaded to Docker Hub anymore.

To build the jupyter-cadquery container image, clone the repo and call `make docker`.

The resulting image is called `bwalter42/jupyter_cadquery:4.0.2` and can be started with:

```bash
WORKDIR=./jupyter-cadquery
docker run -it --rm -v $WORKDIR:/home/workdir -p 8888:8888 bwalter42/jupyter_cadquery:4.0.2
```

Everything stored in `/home/workdir` in the container will be actually stored on the local machine in `$WORKDIR`. The examples are copied into the container in a read-only folder `/home/examples-read-only`

## Usage

### a) Viewer locations

- Show the viewer in a jupyterlab-sidecar so that it can be shown/hidden easily:

  ```python
  t = Text("SideCar", 20)
  cv_s = show(t, viewer="SideCar", anchor="right")
  ```

- Show the viewer in a separate JupyterLab window placed at the right or left:

  ```python
  t = Text("Right", 20)
  cv_r = show(t, viewer="Right", anchor="split-right")

  t = Text("Left", 20)
  cv_l = show(t, viewer="Left", anchor="split-left")
  ```

- Show the viewer in a separate JupyterLab window placed at the top or bottom, this time using `open_viewer`:

  ```python
  t = Text("Top", 20)
  cv_t = open_viewer("Top", anchor="split-top", aspect_ratio=0)
  show(t)

  t = Text("Bottom", 20)
  cv_b = open_viewer("Bottom", anchor="split-bottom", aspect_ratio=0)
  show(t)
  ```

  **Notes:**

  - With `aspect_ratio = 0`, the viewer will occupy the complete window. Otherwise it uses the `aspect_ratio` to size the viewer to be visible in the window. It currently only works with `open_viewer`, not with `show`
  - Both `show(obj, viewer="<Viewer name>", anchor="<location>")` and `open_viewer("<Viewer name>", anchor="<location>"); show(obj)` achieve the same.

- **`get_defaults()`:** Get all global defaults
- **`reset_defaults()`**: Reset all defaults back to its initial value

### d) Replay objects

Note, this is not supported in the standalone viewer for the time being.

- **`replay(args)`**

    _Argument `args`:_

  - `cad_obj`: cadquery object
  - `index` (`default=0`): Element in the fluent API stack to show
  - `debug` (`default=False`): Trace building the replay stack
  - `cad_width` (`default=600`): Width of the CAD view
  - `height` (`default=600`): Height of the CAD view

### e) Exports

- **Export as PNG:**

    Display your object via:

    ```python
    cv = show(a1)
    ```

    and adapt the cad view as wanted (camera location, axis, transparency, ...).

    Then call:

    ```python
    cv.export_png("example.png")
    ```

- **Export as HTML:**

    Display your object without using a sidecar (set `viewer` to `None`) via:

    ```python
    cv = show(a1, viewer=None)
    ```

    and adapt the cad view as wanted (camera location, axis, transparency, ...).

    Then call:

    ```python
    cv.export_html()
    ```

    Note: This does not work with viewers in sidecars!


## Release v4

Current version: **v4.0.2** (2025-04-17)

### Changes

v4 is now based on _OCP CAD Viewer for VS Code_, but keeps the behavior very similar to v3.
For the introduced changes, see Migration below

### Fixes

Not tracked for v3 => v4 due to using a new base (_OCP CAD Viewer for VS Code_)


## Migration from 3.x

**Changed behavior:**

- In order to align Jupyter CadQuery with OCP Viewer for VS Code, the following changes have been implemented:
  - After `openviewer(...)` the default viewer location is set. Force to a cell based viewer by using the keyword parameter `viewer=""` instead of `viewer=None`
  - `show` keyword changes
    - `mate_scale` is replaced by `helper_scale`
    - `control = "orbit"` and `control = "Trackball"` are replaced by `orbit_control = True` or `orbit_control = False`
    - `reset_camera` does not take boolean anymore. Use the enum `Camera` (`from jupyter_cadquery import Camera`)
    - `collapse` does not take strings anymore. Use the enum `Collapse` (`from jupyter_cadquery import Collapse`)
    - `default_edge_color` needs to be changed to `default_edgecolor`.
    - `PartGroup`, `Part`, `Faces`, `Edges`, `Vertices` classes do not exist anymore. Use CadQuery or build123d assemblies instead.
    - `optimal_bb` does not exist anymore. The system now determines the right bounding box itself.
    - `js_debug` does not exist anymore. Use `debug`instead.

- Change functions and methods
  - The function `webcol_to_cq` does not exist anymore. Use web color strings (`#80ff80`) or CadQuery / build123d Color classes.
  - The method `select_clipping` is replaced by `viewer.tab = "clip"` (other alternatives are `tree` and `material`)
  - The method `select_tree` is replaced by `viewer.tab = "tree"` (other alternatives are `clip` and `material`)

- Removed functionality
  - The `voila` base standalone viewer is removed. Use `python -m ocp_vscode` now, using the same `show` commands
  - The docker support is reduced to providing a Docker file
  - Export as HTML file is not supported anymore

## Known issues

- [z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) happens some times, especially when using multiple clip planes (cannot be solved in general)
- Measurement feature does not work on binder at the moment (XSRF cookie issue)
